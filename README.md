# CelestialConnections
Git repository for the Celestial Connections project. On the long term this project aims for a relational architecture instlation onthe public space.

Celestial connection consists of two “celestial bodies” projected on architectural bodies. Inhabitants, or visitors of the space can interact/relate with the “celestial bodies”, the public space and with each other at different levels. All these interactions will be interlaced to each other. The details and presentations of the project can be found on my web page. The general overview of the project can be found here [https://rauleal.com/projects/celestial-connections/]. Two experiments i have done some far can be found here [https://rauleal.com/projects/fearful-symmetry/] and here [https://rauleal.com/projects/noisy-heartbeats/]

This repository contains the source code used there and some of the experiments that did not make it t the final presentation. All of thees is freely usable under the Creative Commons license.
